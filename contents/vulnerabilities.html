    <h1>Vulnerabilities OAuthGuard can Detect</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p class="heading">CSRF attack</p>
            <p>CSRF attacks against the OAuth 2.0 redirect_uri can allow an attacker to obtain
            authorization to access OAuth-protected resources without the consent of the
            user. Such attacks are possible for both the Authorization Code Grant Flow and
            the Implicit Grant Flow. An attacker first acquires a code, access token or id
            token relating to its own protected resources. The attacker then aborts the
            redirect flow back to the RP on the attacker's own device, and then, by some
            means, tricks the victim into executing the redirect back to the RP. The RP
            receives the redirect, fetches the attributes from the IdP, and associates the
            victim's RP session with the attacker's resources that are accessible using the
            tokens. The victim user then accesses resources on behalf of the attacker.</p>
            <p>The impact of such an attack depends on the type of resource accessed. For
            example, the user might upload private data to the RP, thinking it is uploading
            information to its own profile at this RP, and this data will subsequently be
            available to the attacker.  As described by Li and Mitchell, an attacker can
            use a CSRF attack to control a victim user's RP account without knowing the
            user's username and password.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p class="heading">Impersonation attack</p>
            <p>This vulnerability stems from confusion about authentication and authorization.
            In OAuth 2.0, an access token is intended for authorization purposes only
            because it is not tied to any specific RP. As the access token is a bearer
            token, it can be used by any RP that gains access to it. If an RP only submits
            an access token to their Google sign-in endpoint, an attacker (malicious RP)
            can submit to the RP's Google sign-in endpoint a victim user's access token
            issued to itself by Google. The RP then uses this access token to get the
            victim user's information from Google; the attacker then gets full access to
            the victim user's account at the RP.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="heading">Authorization Flow Misuse</p>
            <p>OAuth 2.0 has four authorization flows, and OpenID Connect has three
            authentication flows. It is up to RP developers to choose the right flow and
            implement the OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect flows correctly. According to the
            OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards, only a code should be submitted back to
            the RP's Google sign-in endpoint as evidence that the user has been
            authenticated. However, in practice, many RPs submit a combination of code,
            access token and id token back to their Google sign-in endpoint.  This is
            dangerous.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="heading">Unsafe Token Transfer</p>
            <p>The design goal of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect is to allow an RP to access
            user information stored at the IdP without giving the user's IdP account name
            and password.  This is achieved using a code, access token or id token. These
            tokens are vitally important, and need to be protected when transferred between
            the RP and Google (e.g. by using HTTPS). However, many RPs do not use HTTPS to
            protect their Google sign-in data transfers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="heading">Privacy Leakage </p>
            <p>When a user chooses to use Google to log in to an RP website, the user's code,
            access token or id token that the RP retrieves from the Google should never be
            revealed to parties other than the RP.  We refer to the disclosure of such a
            token as a privacy leak. We consider two kinds of privacy leaks, intentional
            and referer (unintentional). The main difference between these two types of
            leak is whether the RP is aware of the leak. Unintentional privacy leaks might
            happen when an RP includes third party content in its Google sign-in endpoint;
            intentional privacy leaks occur when an RP deliberately sends user tokens to a
            third party.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>OAuthGuard can protect user security and privacy against the following
    vulnerabilities</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p class="heading">CSRF Attack Protection. </p>
            <p>OAuthGuard uses the CSRF countermeasures recently proposed by Li and Mitchell
            to protect user security against CSRF attacks when using Google sign-in.
            OAuthGuard first checks the referer header of the HTTP message of an OAuth 2.0
            response.  If the referer header does not points to Google's domain or the RP's
            domain then OAuthGuard knows it is a CSRF attack against the RP's Google
            sign-in endpoint, and accordingly notifies the user that it has blocked a CSRF
            attack attempt.</p>
            
            <p>This technique works for most RPs, but there are a small number of RPs that use
            a proxy service (e.g. gigya) to implement their Google sign-in, or use another
            domain (not the domain registered with Google) as their Google sign-in
            endpoint.  We whitelisted these RP domains in the code, so OAuthGuard will not
            block OAuth 2.0 responses in these cases.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="heading">Impersonation Attack Warning. </p>
            <p>OAuthGuard is able to detect the RP's Google sign-in endpoint and extract all
            three types of token from the HTTP message of an OAuth 2.0 Response. If only an
            access token is submitted to the PR's Google sign-in endpoint, OAuthGuard
            notifies the user that the RP's website is vulnerable to an impersonation
            attack, and the user should stop using Google sign-in at that RP.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="heading">Unsafe Token Transfer Protection.</p>
            <p>OAuthGuard is able to determine the protocol (HHTP or HTTPS) used to transfer
            an OAuth 2.0 response.  When HTTP is used, OAuthGuard tries to redirect the
            response using HTTPS before it leaves the user's browser. This only works when
            HTTPS is available on the RP.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="heading">Privacy Leakage Protection.</p>
            <p> If either of the two types of privacy leak is detected, OAuthGuard notifies the
            users that it has blocked a privacy leakage attempt.</p>
        </li>
